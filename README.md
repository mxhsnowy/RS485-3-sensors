# RS485-3-sensors
This project aimed to transfer data between master and slave through RS-485 protocol. When the master call, the slave will get 3 measurements from 3 sensors (here I use 2 potentiometers and a LM35) and then transfer it to the master, the master will then transfer it to the computer.
